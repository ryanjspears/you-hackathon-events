# Organizations

Daytona provides organizations as a way to group resources and enable collaboration. Users can work individually in their personal organization or together in a collaborative organization.

Go to [Daytona Dashboard ↗](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard) to manage your organizations, or use the [API](https://www.daytona.io/docs/en/tools/api.md#daytona/tag/organizations) to manage them programmatically.

## Personal vs Collaborative

Every Daytona user starts with a personal organization, ideal for solo use and experimentation. Collaborative organizations are created manually and designed for company-wide collaboration with shared access and controls.

| **Feature**        | **Personal organization**        | **Collaborative organization**                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Creation**       | Automatic on signup              | Manually by a user                             |
| **Members**        | Single user only                 | Multiple users (invite-based)                  |
| **Access Control** | No roles or permissions          | Roles with granular resource-based assignments |
| **Billing**        | Tied to individual user          | Shared across team members                     |
| **Use Case**       | Personal testing, small projects | Company/team development and production        |
| **Quota Scope**    | Per user                         | Shared across all members                      |
| **Deletable**      | No                               | Yes (by Owner)                                 |

Users can switch between their personal and collaborative organizations by using the dropdown in the [Daytona Dashboard ↗](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard) sidebar. Each organization has its own sandboxes, API keys, and resource quotas.

## Regions

Each organization has a default [region](https://www.daytona.io/docs/en/regions.md) that determines where sandboxes are created when no specific target is provided. Regions represent geographic or logical groupings of compute infrastructure. Organizations can update their default region, manage per-region resource quotas, and query region quota information for individual sandboxes.

For more information on available region types, see the [Regions](https://www.daytona.io/docs/en/regions.md) guide.
